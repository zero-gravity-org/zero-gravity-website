Welcome to Zero Gravity Project. This file demonstrates the contributing guidelines that every developer/mentor has to adhere
for GirlScript Summer of Code.
This is required in order to create a unified development environment. Let's start. <br />

## The Git Workflow
The workflow that we'll be using is <b> Dev - Staging - Production</b>. All the Pull Request (PR's) will be made to <b>dev</b> branch.
The mentors shall review the PR. If any change is required in the PR, the mentors shall comment on the PR itself else if
everything is good, the mentors will merge the PR to dev.<br />
Once a feature is completed, the code will be merged to <b>staging</b> branch. At this point, the mentors and admin will perform integration testing.
Once a feature is fully tested, only then it will be merged to <b>master</b> branch.<br />
