Welcome to Zero Gravity Project. This file demonstrates the contributing guidelines that every developer/mentor has to adhere
for GirlScript Summer of Code.
This is required in order to create a unified development environment. Let's start. <br />

## The Git Workflow
The workflow that we'll be using is <b> Dev - Staging - Production</b>. All the Pull Request (PR's) will be made to <b>dev</b> branch.
The mentors shall review the PR. If any change is required in the PR, the mentors shall comment on the PR itself else if
everything is good, the mentors will merge the PR to dev.<br />
Once a feature is completed, the code will be merged to <b>staging</b> branch. At this point, the mentors and admin will perform integration testing.
Once a feature is fully tested, only then it will be merged to <b>master</b> branch.<br />

## Fork
<b>It is strictly for the participants. Please read it carefully.</b><br />
Every participant(s) is required to fork this repository and make changes on the forked repository and after making all the changes, make a Pull Request to <b>dev branch</b>.

## Issue creation
<b>It is strictly for the mentors and admin. Please read it carefully.</b><br />
Mentors and admin are requested to make issues and mark them with GSSoC label. Add separate labels like `up for grab`, `beginner`, `easy`, `medium`, `hard`. After someone comments on the issue, remove the `up for grab` label. If the person doesn't respond in 2 days, add `up for grab` label again to let other participants know that the issue is available to work on.

Please reach out to any of the below members for help. Good luck!
